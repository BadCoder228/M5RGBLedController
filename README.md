# M5RGBLedController
welp i was bored back then...

so lets get started

u need:
1x M5Hub
1x M5RGBLed
1x M5Hub upgrade(i mean for motor inputs)
3x Motor wires 
3x Medium sized motors
1x Red lego stick
1x Blue lego stick
1x Green lego stick 

so now u needa combine 'em all:
take ur 3 motors and attach a stick for each
then u gotta do ur upgrade(just switch ur M5Hub bottom part to new one)
after that u gotta take ur wires and then connect ur motors to M5Hub bottom part in that order:
take ur motor with red stick and then connect it to M5Hub bottom PORT 1.
take ur motor with green stick and then connect it to M5Hub bottom PORT 2.
the same description for blue one, so just connect it to port 3.

after that prepare ur VScode by downloading Platformio and specifical modules there.
then u gotta copy MY src folder and replace ur with mine.

finally connect ur M5Hub to ur pc via wire select file called "main.cpp" and then it will be installed to ur M5Hub automatically. 


and yeah thats all, but how u can change ur RGBLed color?
just rotate any of ur sticks aand watch whats happening.
